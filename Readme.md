# Long Text in Markdown

## Introduction

## Presentation

Some description.

## Section 1: Getting Started

### What is Markdown?

Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax that can be converted to HTML and other formats. It was created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004 with the goal of providing an easy-to-read and easy-to-write text format that can be converted to HTML.

### Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of Markdown includes elements like headings, lists, links, and images. For example:

- Lists are created using dashes, asterisks, or plus signs.
- Headings are created using hash (#) symbols.
- Links are created using square brackets and parentheses.

### Tables

Markdown allows you to create simple tables using pipes (|) and dashes (-). For example:

| Name  | Age |
|-------|-----|
| John  | 30  |
| Jane  | 28  |
| James | 32  |
